\title{Prioritize and Combine Transcript Annotations}
\usage{
pick_transcripts(anno_priority, anno_second)
}
\arguments{
\item{anno_priority}{A \code{GRanges} object containing the priority set of transcript annotations.
These annotations are given precedence, and any overlapping transcripts in the secondary set
(\code{anno_second}) are removed.}

\item{anno_second}{A \code{GRanges} object containing the secondary set of transcript annotations.
Overlaps with the priority set result in these transcripts being excluded from the final combined set.}
}
\value{
A \code{GRanges} object representing the combined set of annotations from both input sets,
after resolving overlaps by retaining priority set transcripts and excluding overlapping transcripts
from the secondary set. The resulting annotations are sorted by genomic coordinates.
}
\description{
This function takes two sets of transcript annotations and prioritizes one over the other.
When transcripts from the two sets overlap, those from the priority set are retained,
and the overlapping transcripts from the secondary set are removed. The result is a combined
set of annotations that includes all non-overlapping transcripts from both sets, with precedence
given to transcripts from the priority set in case of overlaps.
}
\examples{
library(GenomicRanges)
library(plyranges)
# Assume `anno_priority` and `anno_second` are `GRanges` objects loaded or created previously
combined_annotations <- pick_transcripts(anno_priority, anno_second)
print(combined_annotations)
}
