\title{Adjust Transcript and Gene Boundaries in GRanges Object}
\usage{
adjust_transcript_gene_boundaries(gr)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{A GRanges object containing genomic annotations, including transcripts
and genes. The object should have metadata columns for 'transcript_id' and 'gene_id'.}
}
\value{
A modified GRanges object with adjusted start and end positions for
transcripts and genes.
}
\description{
This function takes a GRanges object and adjusts the start and end positions
for transcripts and genes based on their associated features. For transcripts,
the start and end positions are adjusted to encompass all its features. Similarly,
gene boundaries are adjusted to encompass all associated transcripts and features.
The function is designed to work with genomic annotation data where accurate
boundary information is crucial for downstream analysis.

# Assuming `gr` is a GRanges object with transcript and gene annotations
adjusted_gr <- adjust_transcript_gene_boundaries(gr)
