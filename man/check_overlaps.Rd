\title{Checks for Various Types of Overlapping Genomic Ranges}
\usage{
check_overlaps(annot_gr)
}
\arguments{
\item{annot_gr}{A \code{GRanges} object with annotations for genomic features, including but not limited to,
types like "CDS", "five_prime_UTR", and "three_prime_UTR". Each range is expected to include metadata specifying
the feature type.}
}
\value{
A list containing \code{GRanges} objects for each type of overlap identified: exons overlapping with other exons,
CDS overlapping with 5' UTRs, and CDS overlapping with 3' UTRs. If no overlaps are found for a specific category,
a message is printed, and the category is excluded from the output list.
}
\description{
This function examines a \code{GRanges} object for overlaps between different genomic features,
such as exons, CDS (Coding Sequences), and UTRs (Untranslated Regions). It identifies overlaps
within exons, between CDS and 5' UTRs, and between CDS and 3' UTRs, returning a detailed list of these overlaps.
The function is intended to work on annotated genomic ranges that include information on feature types.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `annot_gr` is a GRanges object with annotations:
overlaps_list <- check_overlaps(annot_gr)
# `overlaps_list` will contain lists of overlapping genomic ranges for specified features.
