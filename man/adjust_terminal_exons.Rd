\title{Adjust Terminal Exons in GRanges Object}
\usage{
adjust_terminal_exons(gr)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{A GRanges object containing genomic annotations with exon features.
The object should have a metadata column for 'transcript_id' and must distinguish
exon types in a 'type' metadata column.}
}
\value{
A modified GRanges object with adjusted positions for terminal exons
within each transcript.
}
\description{
This function processes a GRanges object to identify and adjust terminal exons
for each transcript. It first identifies the terminal (first and last) exons based
on their positions within the transcript. Then, it adjusts the start and end positions
of these terminal exons to ensure accurate representation of exon boundaries. This
adjustment is critical for analyses that rely on precise exon-intron structure,
such as differential exon usage or transcript assembly.
