\title{Calculate Regions Around Feature Ends}
\usage{
get_regions_around_end(gr, upstream = 500, downstream = 500)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{A \code{GRanges} object containing genomic features for which to calculate end-centered regions.}

\item{upstream}{The distance upstream of the feature end (towards the 5' end for positive strands,
towards the 3' end for negative strands) to include in the new region. Default is 500 bases.}

\item{downstream}{The distance downstream of the feature end (towards the 3' end for positive strands,
towards the 5' end for negative strands) to include in the new region. Default is 500 bases.}
}
\value{
A \code{GRanges} object containing the new regions around the ends of the original features,
including all metadata (elementMetadata) from the input \code{GRanges} object. For positive-strand features,
the regions extend upstream and downstream from the feature's end; for negative-strand features,
the regions extend upstream and downstream from the feature's start.
}
\description{
Generates new genomic regions centered around the ends of features in a given \code{GRanges} object.
The function adjusts these regions based on specified upstream and downstream distances,
taking into account the orientation of each feature (strand). The resulting regions aim to
capture areas immediately adjacent to the feature ends, potentially useful for analyzing
regulatory elements or extending annotations.
